Part 2 README

You’re going to make your own HTML page and you’re going to make 2 CSS themes for it. Emulate the 2nd and 3rd design from this comic: http://theoatmeal.com/comics/design_hell, but instead make a 1 webpage that advertises you to employers.

Include at least 3 sections:

Who you are + photo
Your professional history
What you can do for a potential employer/what you have to offer
Then a sidebar of important points they should know about you.

Make 1 ugly CSS and 1 good CSS just like the design_hell comic.

You should make a page good enough you’d actually use it as your homepage.

Requirements

[X] 4 sections: who you are, your history, what you have to offer, important points about you
[X] 1 Ugly CSS theme
[X] 1 good CSS theme
[X] 2 HTML files, each with the same content but different CSS
[X] your photo (try to keep it professional)
[ ] Take 2 screenshots of firefox running all of your pages that demonstrates your theme.
